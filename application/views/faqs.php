                                    <p>Every car we sell is CarMax Certified, which means no flood or frame damage, and no salvage history. In addition, it means a car has passed our 125+ point inspection and undergone a detailed reconditioning process. A small sample of our 125+ point inspection includes checking all engine components and associated systems for proper operation, leaks, abnormal noises, corrosion, bad connections, or excessive wear. Tires and wheels must pass an inspection and are replaced when wear exceeds state or local law.</p>

                                    <p>None of the cars we buy are ever sold to you "as-is." In addition to replacing worn parts found during our 125+ point inspection, we spend an average of 15 hours reconditioning each car. When it comes to the exterior, we pull out dimples, buff and color-match scratches, restore headlights, and repair discoloration caused by acid or oxidation. Inside, we remove stains, repair holes or tears, remove debris from all surfaces and hard to reach places, and repair or replace any excessively worn carpet. These are only a few examples from our extensive reconditioning checklist.</p>

                                <div class="b-more__info-block-inside j-inside">
                                    <p>Some of our cars may have unrepaired safety recalls on them. There are several reasons for this, but at the core is the fact that the current recall system is based on the manufacturer's relationship with its dealers, repair facilities, and registered vehicle owners, and not with independent dealers, like CarMax. Recalls are required to be repaired by manufacturer-authorized repair facilities and manufacturers have not authorized CarMax to complete safety recall repairs and close out repaired recalls. Before you purchase a used car from CarMax, a CarMax Associate will review an AutoCheck report and results from the NHTSA Recall Look-Up with you. CarMax urges customers prior to purchase to have unrepaired safety recalls fixed by the manufacturer immediately.</p>

                                    <p>There are several tools to help you find and buy your next car. You can use our car payment calculator to estimate a budget, or get pre-approved to help you know which inventory meets your actual budget. You can also schedule an appointment to get a free trade-in offer for your current car, which can be applied to your down payment.</p>
                                    <p>When you create a MyCarMax account, you can save favorite cars, save specific search criteria, and set up alerts so you always know as soon as a car you like is added to our inventory.

                                    <p>Yes. By saving your searches, you can sit back and let us notify you when the perfect car is added to our inventory. To save a search, use the "Save Search" link located directly below the search filters. This option will only appear if you have selected at least one filter in your search. If you don't already have a MyCarMax account, you will be prompted to create one. There you can adjust the frequency of your saved-search inventory alerts.</p>

                                    <p>Yes. There are two ways to save a car to a list of favorites. On your search results list, choose the "Save" button located on the bottom right of each search result. On the car detail page, choose the "Save to Favorites" link to the right of the main photo. If you haven't already, you will be prompted to create a My CarMax account, where you can access your personal favorites list, easily compare car pricing and features, and stay updated on a car's availability.</p>
