In addition, with your consent, our mobile device-ready website or mobile app (our “Mobile Services”) may collect precise information about the geographic location of your device. If your device is equipped with GPS or can connect with wireless access points or hot spots, or if your device is also a phone that communicates with cell towers or satellites, then your device is able to use these features to determine its precise geographic location.

Once you set your device to transmit its location information to us, your device will continue to transmit its location information to us(when it is open) until you set your device to no longer do so.You may at any time opt out from further allowing us to have access to your device’s location information by accessing our app’s location settings on your device and setting your device not to share its location with us.
